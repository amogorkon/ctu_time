## ⚡ Why This Solves Real Problems

### The DST Body Count
- **24% spike** in heart attacks after spring forward ([AHA Journal](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.316319))
- **6% increase** in fatal crashes post-DST ([Current Biology, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982220303021))

Clock shifts aren't just annoying — they're deadly.

## 🧠 What Is CTU?

**CTU (Calculated Time Uncoordinated)** is a 24-hour timekeeping system:
- **Anchored to the sun** — 12:00 is always solar noon.
- **Midnight is always 00:00**, no matter the solar drift.
- **Only the final hour (23:00–00:00)** is dynamically stretched/compressed to keep the system aligned with Earth's rotation.


### 🕰️ Example: Real-Time Reasoning

```python
# CTU-based school logic
if 8 <= ctu_time.hour < 12:
    engage_students_in_high_focus_tasks()
elif 12 <= ctu_time.hour < 15:
    encourage_rest_and_light_activity()
```

## 💡 CTU vs Artificial Time

| **Human Need**         | **Legacy Systems**               | **CTU Advantage**                              |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Jet Lag Recovery       | Timezones misaligned with sun   | “Arrival: 16:00 CTU” = True local solar time   |
| Night Shift Health     | 22:00–06:00 varies by light      | 20:00–04:00 CTU = Stable solar night context   |
| Remote Work Sync       | “15:00 UTC” lacks meaning        | “15:00 UTC (09:00 CTU SF)” = Solar-anchored    |

## 🌍 CTU’s Vision for Daily Life

### 1. Eliminate DST Trauma
- No spring/fall time shifts — the midnight hour adapts silently.
- Natural alignment = **+24 mins sleep/year** from unbroken circadian rhythm.

### 2. Chrono-Biological Standards

```python
# Example: CTU-aligned treatment delivery
if is_optimal_ctu_window(patient, ctu_time.hour):
    deliver_chemo()  # Matches cellular repair cycles
```

- **Sports recovery, learning, productivity** — all benefit from solar-truth anchoring.

### 3. A Universal Solar Context
- “Available 14:00–18:00 my CTU” — means something anywhere on Earth.
- **Streetlight automation**: Triggers at 18:00 CTU, not an arbitrary clock hour.

## 🔧 How It Works (Technical Summary)

- Every CTU day is centered around **solar noon**.
- The **final hour of the day (23:00–00:00)** dynamically absorbs the small fluctuations in the solar day (±30s typical).
- This keeps **12:00:00 CTU = True Solar Noon**, globally, as well as **0:00:00 CTU = True Solar Midnight**
- Conversions to/from UTC are precise and **roundtrip-safe to within ±1μs** for all but ~30 edge seconds/year (which fallback smoothly to ~1 sec error).

## 🧪 What CTU Is and Isn’t

### ✅ CTU Guarantees:
- 12:00 is always solar noon (to within astronomical precision).
- Midnight is always 00:00.
- Fully UTC-compatible.
- Resilient to leap seconds and drift.

### 🚫 CTU Doesn’t:
- Replace UTC in backend tech.
- Predict dawn/dusk (requires latitude input).
- Solve sleep disorders (we still need to fix light pollution).

## 🧭 Ready to Rethink Time?

CTU isn’t just a clock — it’s a return to natural time. A system that’s:

- **Biologically attuned**
- **Technically precise**
- **Human-centered**

Because you shouldn't need a time zone to tell you where the sun is.
